As an artform, music pervades society and occupies a significant place in world cultures and in the oral and recorded history of all civilisations.

Music plays important roles in the social, cultural, aesthetic and spiritual lives of people. At an individual level, music is a medium of personal expression. It enables the sharing of ideas, feelings and experiences.", "The study of music combines the development of affective, cognitive and psychomotor domains in the act of making music. It allows for the expression of emotion and imagination, the intellect and the exploration of values. Music fosters an understanding of continuity and change, and of the connections between different times and cultures. The nature of musical study also allows students to develop their capacity to manage their own learning, engage in problem-solving, work collaboratively and engage in activity that reflects the real world practice of performers, composers and audiences. The study of music fosters knowledge, understanding and skills that contribute to lifelong processes of learning and to the appreciation and enjoyment of music.", "While students will develop knowledge and skills in each of the individual areas of performing, composing and listening, the integration of experiences in these areas enhances the understanding and manipulation of the concepts of music in differing musical contexts.", "The purpose of the Years 7-10 syllabus is to provide students with the opportunity to build on the knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes gained in Stage 3 and encourage the desire to continue learning in formal and informal musical settings beyond Stage 5.

It has an important function as a tool for developing knowledge, understanding and skills in a variety of aspects of music. The improviser draws on known information and seeks to re-order it to produce something different.", "There are many types of improvisation. The role it plays varies in different genres, periods and styles of music. For example, improvisation or extemporisation in baroque music is an important stylistic feature for study.  Additionally, the performance of most contemporary popular music involves improvisation. It may occur in one section of a piece of music or may be the form of production of the entire piece, particularly in jazz.", "Teachers are encouraged to include improvisation as an integral part of teaching programs. Working with improvisation can begin at very basic levels of experimenting with sounds within set parameters to complex improvisations.  Teachers should consider the musical development of the students and encourage the skill of improvisation at every level." ],
