They might be in the sentences or paragraphs surrounding an unfamiliar word. Typical context clues may be: a definition or restatement of the word, an example of the word, a synonym for the word, a contrasting word, a cause and effect relationship, information about the topic and subject of the text, or the grammatical function of the word as it is used in the text.<br/>This resource might be used when students have explored literal comprehension and are interpreting more complex texts that include abstract ideas and vocabulary. Alternatively, this resource can be used as a standalone activity targeting specific skills. Teachers can adapt the activity to suit their current unit of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within this task based on the focus vocabulary selected by the teacher.<br/>Teachers can also use this learning sequence as a model for developing their own lesson sequence based on other quality texts.

These books could be used for independent student practise when learning the phoneme and their corresponding graphemes for /h/ as in hat, /b/ as in bat, /f/ as in fish, /l/ as in lip.<br/>It can also be used for practise when learning that another way to represent the /s/ phoneme is with an SS, as in the word hiss.

Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts.<br/>Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Phonemic awareness is a basic phonological awareness skill and is important as a foundation and precursor skill for learning to decode and encode written words.<br/>It Is necessary to grasp the alphabetic code that underlies the system of written language. That is letters (graphemes) on the page are a code for phonemes in spoken words. Blending phonemes together smoothly to say words supports decoding and fluency in word learning and recognition.<br/>Proficiency in oral blending and segmenting before introducing the layer of phonics lessens the cognitive load making it easier to blend and segment with letters." ],

These power point lessons could be used with a whole class or small groups when explicitly introducing the phonemes /h/ as in hat, /b/ as in bat, /f/ as in fish, and the graphemes that can be used to represent these sounds. It also focuses on showing how to blend the letter/sounds to make and read words.<br/>These PowerPoint lessons are fully editable, allowing teachers to adapt lessons and activities based on student need." ],

Scripts also present an opportunity to explore new vocabulary.<br/>Teachers can tailor this learning resource by using other scripts or modifying texts to suit a spoken platform.

They include activities and opportunities for students to blend to read words and segment to write words. This PowerPoint is part of a package of complementary resources, that also includes printable decodable texts and student independent practice sheets. These power point lessons could be used with a whole class or small groups when explicitly introducing the phonemes /l/ as in lip and the graphemes that can be used to represent these sounds. It can also be used when learning that another way to represent the /s/ phoneme is with an SS, as in the word hiss. It also focuses on showing how to blend the letter/sounds to make and read words.<br/>These PowerPoint lessons are fully editable, allowing teachers to adapt lessons and activities based on student need." ],

There are individual assessments that assess either grammar, punctuation or spelling, as well as assessments that assess a combination of these language features. The short assessments are mapped to NSW syllabus outcomes for Stage 4 and Literacy Learning Progression indicators. Teachers can group together or modify these short assessments to suit the learning needs of their students. They are easy to administer and available as Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, and PDF. When students have completed the assessments, teachers can download a class overview in the form of an excel spreadsheet detailing their student responses.<br/>When using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms, the student receives immediate feedback on their answers. Teachers can use this information to inform planning and programming.<br/>This resource can be used for both formative and summative assessment.<br/>The short assessments are grouped by stage with links to K-10 English syllabus outcomes clearly identified. Each assessment question is also linked to a specific learning progression indicator, to assist teachers in selecting the most appropriate assessments and questions to use with students." ],

These power point lessons could be used with a whole class or small groups when explicitly introducing the phonemes /e/ as in egg, /u/ as in up, /r/ as in rat and the graphemes that can be used to represent these sounds.

Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts.<br/>Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Phonemic manipulation is an advanced phonological awareness skill and is important for phonic decoding and word learning. Skilled readers demonstrate phonemic proficiency.<br/>Being able to delete, substitute and add phonemes in words is an important skill to develop as it helps students test alternatives for reading and spelling. The resource includes details of how to increase or decrease the complexity of the activity by the level of phoneme manipulation and the position of the phoneme manipulated within a word." ],

Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts.<br/>Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Phonemic awareness is a basic phonological awareness skill and is important as a foundation and precursor skill for learning to decode and encode written words.<br/>It Is necessary to grasp the alphabetic code that underlies the system of written language. That is letters (graphemes) on the page are a code for phonemes in spoken words. Blending phonemes together smoothly to say words supports decoding and fluency in word learning and recognition.<br/>Proficiency in oral blending and segmenting before introducing the layer of phonics lessens the cognitive load making it easier to blend and segment with letters.<br/>The resource includes details of how to increase or decrease the complexity of the activity by using words increasing in number and complexity of phonemes and also level of skill development ranging from identifying through to blending and segmenting phonemes." ],

Students examine how characters are portrayed through their literal and inferred traits, behaviours and actions. Teachers might use these activities when considering imaginative texts in particular.<br/>The activities in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills in analysing characterisation and how this is established in texts.<br/>Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning.

Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts.<br/>Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Rhyming and onset & rime awareness is an early phonological awareness skill used as a scaffold for learning phonemic awareness skills. Having this awareness supports refining the skill of tuning into the sound structure within a spoken word.<br/>Using onset and rime as the units of sound builds on prior learning and further develops the skill of blending and segmenting needed for phonemic awareness.<br/>The resource includes details of how to increase or decrease the complexity of the activity ranging in stages from recognition through to production of rhymes." ],

  "description" : [ "Rolling four dice activity is a task that supports additive thinking.<br/>This task supports students' understanding and development of flexible strategies with 2-digit numbers. Students need efficient counting practices in number sense and place value to support additive thinking. Knowing and describing teen numbers as 1 ten and some more (QuN8.3) can be observed through this task. Students need a deep understanding of place value to be able to count, decompose, rename and exchange numbers in multiple ways.<br/>Teachers can use this activity to target their teaching on developing students' flexible strategies to 10 and working mathematically skills.

Students examine how layout, punctuation and key features shape imaginative, informative and persuasive texts.<br/>This resource can be used to develop student skill in identifying and analysing text features across a range of types of texts and subject areas. Students consider punctuation in context and the effect of different fonts before identifying and analysing key features of imaginative, informative and persuasive texts. These activities can be easily used and adapted across KLAs.<br/>The activities in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills in identifying and analysing text features across types of text and KLAs.<br/>Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas." ],

  "description" : [ "Rolling two dice is a task that supports additive thinking.<br/>This activity is for students to develop flexible strategies with numbers up to 20. Students need efficient counting practices in number sense and place value to support additive thinking. Knowing and describing teen numbers as 1 ten and some more (QuN8.3) can be observed through this task. Students need a understanding of place value to be able to count, decompose, rename and exchange numbers in multiple ways.<br/>Teachers can use this to target their teaching for students who need to develop their perceptual skills.

Word awareness is one of the five subskills of phonological awareness.<br/>Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts. Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Word awareness is an early phonological awareness skill. It is the first step in tuning into the sound structure of spoken language. Word awareness assists in making the connection between the spoken and written word. Using words as the unit of sound supports learning the skill of segmenting.<br/>The resource includes details of how to increase or decrease the complexity of the activity by using more or less complex words and increased sentence length.

  "description" : [ "Tic-tac-ten is a task that supports additive thinking.<br/>The well-known game of noughts and crosses forms the bases of this game. Students need to aim to get 10 in a row. This task supports students to build their understanding about knowing what eight is and what is 'before' and 'after', also what sits 'inside' of eight six and two, 5 and 2 and 1 is vital knowledge for number sense.<br/>Teachers can use this activity to target their teaching on developing students' flexible strategies to 10 and working mathematically skills.

The assessments are mapped to NSW syllabus outcomes from Stage 4 to Stage 5 and Literacy Learning Progression indicators. They are also mapped to relevant teaching strategies and links to these are provided. Teachers can group together or modify these short assessments to suit the learning needs of their students. They are easy to administer and available as Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, and PDF. When students have completed the assessments, teachers can download a class overview in the form of an excel spreadsheet detailing their student responses. When using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms, the student receives immediate feedback on their answers. Teachers can use this information to inform planning and programming.<br/>This resource can be used for both formative and summative assessment.<br/>The short assessments are grouped by stage with links to K-10 English syllabus outcomes clearly identified. Each assessment question is also linked to a specific learning progression indicator, to assist teachers in selecting the most appropriate assessments and questions to use with students." ],

Teachers might use these activities when students have already explored descriptive language and structural features of texts and are now exploring figurative and playful language choices.<br/>Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas." ],

  "description" : [ "This guide has a suggested sequence for the steps involved in the explicit teaching of a phoneme. A link to a video of an example lesson is included.<br/>Phonemic awareness is one of the five subskills of phonological awareness. Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts.<br/>Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Phonemic awareness is a basic phonological awareness skill and is important as a foundation and precursor skill for learning to decode and encode written words. It Is necessary to grasp the alphabetic code that underlies the system of written language. That is letters (graphemes) on the page are a code for phonemes in spoken words. Blending phonemes together smoothly to say words supports decoding and fluency in word learning and recognition.<br/>Proficiency in oral blending and segmenting before introducing the layer of phonics lessens the cognitive load making it easier to blend and segment with letters.<br/>The resource includes details of how to scaffold the activity with supporting materials to meet specific learning needs." ],

Students learn to identify and use a range of devices that link information across and within texts in increasingly sophisticated ways.<br/>This resource can be used to strengthen comprehension and critical analysis of texts by explicitly teaching students about devices that link information across and within texts. Students identify key cohesive devices and examine how composers use these to make meaning. These activities can be easily used and adapted across all KLAs.<br/>The activities in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills in how to identify how ideas are connected across and within texts and how this can shape meaning.<br/>Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas." ],

They are an important part of explicit teaching and can be used to ensure that students understand how skilled readers use a range of metacognitive strategies to comprehend and interact with texts.<br/>This resource is an example of a think aloud using a text from the Eat for health website as part of a Stage 3 PDHPE focus on healthy eating habits. Think alouds can be used at all stages of explicit teaching. It is important that teachers use think alouds during modelled instruction and shared practice as this will provide students with an opportunity to see and hear the cognitive processing a skilled reader uses when comprehending texts. Once students are confident with the process of a think aloud and the focus skill of the learning sequence, think alouds can also be adapted for use in guided and collaborative practice. This will provide the opportunity for students to verbalise their thinking and receive feedback from their peers. Think alouds can be adapted and used with students across all grades and in all subject areas. " ],

This resource will enable students to build their decoding, phonics, spelling and vocabulary skills. When students add or rearrange letters to make a new word, they must examine the phoneme/grapheme relationships with automaticity and pace. By doing so, students learn to decode and spell accurately. By adding meaning, in the form of a definition, students can extend their understanding of words and concepts." ],

Syllable awareness is one of the five subskills of phonological awareness.<br/>Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts. Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>The skills of segmenting and blending are easier to learn using syllables, a larger unit of sound. Developing fluency and automaticity using syllables makes the process easier when students are ready to blend and segment using phonemes, the smallest unit of sound. Students must have an understanding, of what a 'word' is, before beginning instruction in syllable awareness.<br/>The resource includes details of how to increase or decrease the complexity of the activity by using more or less complex words.

There are individual assessments that assess either grammar, punctuation or spelling, as well as assessments that assess a combination of these language features. The short assessments are mapped to NSW syllabus outcomes from Stage 2 to Stage 3 and Literacy Learning Progression indicators. Teachers can group together or modify these short assessments to suit the learning needs of their students. They are easy to administer and available as Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, and PDF. When students have completed the assessments, teachers can download a class overview in the form of an excel spreadsheet detailing their student responses. When using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms, the student receives immediate feedback on their answers. Teachers can use this information to inform planning and programming.<br/>This resource can be used for both formative and summative assessment.<br/>The short assessments are grouped by stage with links to K-10 English syllabus outcomes clearly identified. Each quiz question is also linked to a specific learning progression indicator, to assist teachers in selecting the most appropriate assessments and questions to use with students." ],

This resource might be used when students are learning about the structural and text features of imaginative, persuasive and informative types of text, and are learning about why and how texts are constructed.<br/>The activities in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills in identifying audience and purpose and how these are established. Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas." ],

An important consideration involves knowing how to think about words and their power for communicating ideas. This understanding will support teachers to choose the best words for focused instruction.<br/>The three-tiered model of vocabulary development, described by Beck, McKeown, and Kucan (2013) is a framework to classify words.<br/>This guide explains the three tiers and provides questions to support teachers as they select Tier 2 words for explicit instruction and assessment. The guide also includes an example list of Tier 2 and 3 words for a science unit of study (insert link https://education.nsw.gov.au/content/dam/main-education/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/key-learning-areas/science/media/documents/science-and-technology-s3-earth-and-space-learning-sequence.docx).<br/>Teachers can use the guide when planning units of learning in all subject areas.

As they work through a number of noticing and wondering discussions, adjusting their thinking with each new piece of information, they develop a better understanding of the data story in both its whole and its parts. Numberless graphs build on the work of Brian Bushart and 'numberless word problems'. In his blog Teaching to the beat of a different drummer, Brian Bushart states, 'numberless word problems are designed to provide scaffolding that allows students the opportunity to develop a better understanding of the underlying structure of word problems.' He later applied this idea to numberless graphs." ],

A number of prefixes are explored and students are provided with opportunities to practise reading words with prefixes in isolation and in texts.<br/>The tasks in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills used to understand prefixes.

This resource can be used throughout all learning in all subject areas to explore language and build their own vocabulary knowledge. The activities in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills in vocabulary development.<br/>Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning.

It provides more information about the depth of understanding students have in relation to the words they highlighted when using the Vocabulary recognition tool.<br/>After completing the Vocabulary recognition tool, students sort the words that they recognised or highlighted into different categories. The categories are ones previously identified by the teacher and related to explicit vocabulary instruction that occurred when learning about a topic.<br/>This resource can be used as a follow up to the Vocabulary recognition assessment tool. It can be used to assess student knowledge of the connections between different words that have been the focus of explicit instruction within a topic or unit of learning. Teachers can cater for the learning needs of individual students by selecting what vocabulary will be the focus of explicit instruction and targeted assessment." ],

The questions relate to a stimulus text covering reading comprehension, reading processes and vocabulary.<br/>The assessments are mapped to NSW syllabus outcomes from Stage 2 to Stage 3 and Literacy Learning Progression indicators. They are also mapped to relevant teaching strategies and links to these are provided. Teachers can group together or modify these short assessments to suit the learning needs of their students. They are easy to administer and available as Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, and PDF. When students have completed the assessments, teachers can download a class overview in the form of an excel spreadsheet detailing their student responses. When using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms, the student receives immediate feedback on their answers. Teachers can use this information to inform planning and programming.<br/>This resource can be used for both formative and summative assessment. The short assessments are grouped by stage with links to K-10 English syllabus outcomes clearly identified. Each assessment question is also linked to a specific learning progression indicator, to assist teachers in selecting the most appropriate assessment and questions to use with students." ],

It assesses student vocabulary knowledge in two main ways; the ability to read and recognise words as well as knowledge of the connections between words and specific learning topics.<br/>Teachers preselect vocabulary to be used in the assessment by identifying words that will be focussed on during a unit of learning (approximately 18) and will also need to include some unrelated words (about 7), which act as both distractors and a deterrent for guessing.<br/>In addition to this assessment tool, the Vocabulary sort assessment tool can be used as a follow up assessment, to gain further information about student vocabulary knowledge, specifically their knowledge of the connections between focus words and the different categories found within learning topics. This resource can be used to assess student vocabulary knowledge both pre and post explicit vocabulary instruction. Teachers can cater for the learning needs of individual students by selecting what vocabulary will be the focus of explicit instruction and targeted assessment." ],

Students use the scale to demonstrate the breadth (number of words) and depth (level of knowing) of their vocabulary knowledge.<br/>The scale supports students to:<br/>- demonstrate word consciousness by recognising if a word is familiar or unfamiliar,<br/>- identify the connections focus words have to other words (synonyms, antonyms and translations),<br/>- define or explain the meaning/s of focus vocabulary,<br/>- use focus words appropriately by writing sentence/s (writing multiple sentences provides an opportunity for students to show how words can sometimes have multiple meanings or that they can be used in different contexts).<br/>This resource can be used to assess student vocabulary knowledge both pre and post explicit vocabulary instruction. Teachers can cater for the learning needs of individual students by selecting what vocabulary will be the focus of explicit instruction and targeted assessment." ],

  "description" : [ "The Word mat vocabulary routine is a visual graphic organiser that can support students in defining and deepening their understanding of unfamiliar vocabulary.<br/>The completed graphic organiser can then be used as a visual reference and resource for students. Explicit vocabulary instruction supports the development of vocabulary breadth (the number of words an individual knows the meaning of) and depth (being able to define words, provide attributes of the word, and supply examples of other semantically related words) of students.<br/>The Word mat vocabulary routine is a modified version of a Frayer Model. It can be used by teachers to support explicit teaching of focus vocabulary as well as to develop effective routines for exploring vocabulary. The Word mat vocabulary routine provides an opportunity for students to develop a deep understandings of words, by supporting the explicit teaching of the meanings of introduced vocabulary, the relationships and connections between words, as well as opportunities to practice using new vocabulary through listening, speaking, reading and writing activities.<br/>This resource can be used to support explicit vocabulary instruction and student exploration of tier 2 words. Once completed, the graphic organiser can be displayed in the classroom for further reference by students. Teachers select vocabulary that will be the focus of explicit instruction based on individual student learning needs. " ],

A Frayer model is one of the many graphic organisers that can be used to develop and deepen student understanding of vocabulary. Traditionally, the Frayer model has the word or concept in the middle of four boxes. The four boxes can be titled in various ways, including: definition, essential characteristics, examples, non-examples, synonyms, antonyms, morphology, and function.<br/>A Frayer model is best used following explicit instruction as an opportunity for students to further explore, develop and deepen their understanding of vocabulary. The titles in each of the boxes on the Frayer model can be adapted according to need and teaching focus. " ],

Students examine evidence in texts to understand how a composer's perspective and bias may be positioning the responder.<br/>This resource can be used to strengthen critical analysis of texts by explicitly teaching students how to recognise author perspective and bias and how this can be used to position the responder. Teachers might use these activities when considering the structural and language features of texts and in the study of current or controversial issues.<br/>The activities in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills in critically analysing author perspective and bias and how these are established.<br/>Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas." ],

The Morphemic word chain vocabulary routine can be used by teachers to explicitly teach morphemes to support student vocabulary development. Morphemes are the smallest meaning parts found in words and include prefixes, suffixes and word roots.<br/>The Morphemic word chain supports student reflection, analysis and manipulation of these different meaning-based elements in words to read, comprehend and spell more words, building the breadth and depth of their vocabulary knowledge.<br/>Once completed, the graphic organiser can be displayed in the classroom for further reference by students during reading and writing activities.<br/>This resource can be used to support explicit vocabulary instruction as well as the explicit teaching of spelling. Teachers select vocabulary that will be the focus of explicit instruction based on individual student learning needs. " ],

Teachers can use the texts suggested or adapt the activities to current units of learning. There is advice for teachers about differentiation and adjustments to meet the needs of diverse learners." ],

The intent is for students to read fluently with correct phrasing, intonation, pausing and reading rate. This resource can be used to explicitly develop student's word recognition automaticity and decoding skills when reading printed lyrics to develop student's prosody. Furthermore it develops understanding of the role intonation, pausing and pace has in fluent reading.<br/>This resource can be tailored by selecting poems and rhymes aligned to a particular topic, theme or poet. Students could prepare a poem or rhyme to share with a partner or the class. A poem or rhyme could be prepared as a class assembly item." ],
