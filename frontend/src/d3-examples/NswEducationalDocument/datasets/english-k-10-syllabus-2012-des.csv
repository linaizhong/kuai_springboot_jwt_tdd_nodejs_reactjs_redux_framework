"Introduction","","K–10 curriculum","The NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) syllabuses are developed with respect to some overarching views about education. These include the NESA K–10 Curriculum Framework and Statement of Equity Principles and the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians (December 2008).nNESA syllabuses include agreed Australian Curriculum content and content that clarifies the scope, breadth and depth of learning. The Australian Curriculum achievement standards underpin the syllabus outcomes and the Stage statements for Early Stage 1 to Stage 5.nIn accordance with the K–10 Curriculum Framework and the Statement of Equity Principles, the syllabus takes into account the diverse needs of all students. It identifies essential knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes. It outlines clear standards of what students are expected to know and be able to do in K–10. It provides structures and processes by which teachers can provide continuity of study for all students.nThe framework also provides a set of broad learning outcomes that summarise the knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes essential for all students in all learning areas to succeed in and beyond their schooling.nThe continued relevance of the K–10 Curriculum Framework is consistent with the intent of the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians (December 2008), which sets the direction for Australian schooling for the next 10 years. There are two broad goals:nGoal 1: Australian schooling promotes equity and excellencenGoal 2: All young Australians become successful learners, confident and creative individuals, and active and informed citizens.nThe way in which learning in the English K–10 Syllabus contributes to the curriculum, and to students’ achievement of the broad learning outcomes, is outlined in the syllabus rationale.","","","",""

"Rationale","Language shapes our understanding of ourselves and our world. It is the primary means by which we relate to others and is central to the intellectual, social and emotional development of all students. In the years of schooling from Kindergarten to Year 10, English is the study and use of the English language in its various textual forms. These encompass spoken, written and visual texts of varying complexity through which meaning is shaped, conveyed, interpreted and reflected.nIn acknowledgement of its role as the national language, English is the mandatory subject from Kindergarten to Year 12 in the NSW curriculum. Knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes acquired in English are central to the learning and development of students in NSW. Developing proficiency in English enables students to take their place as confident communicators, critical and imaginative thinkers, lifelong learners and informed, active participants in Australian society. It supports the development and expression of a system of personal values, based on students’ understanding of moral and ethical matters, and gives expression to their hopes and ideals.nThe study of English from Kindergarten to Year 10 should develop a love of literature and learning and be challenging and enjoyable. It develops skills to enable students to experiment with ideas and expression, to become active, independent and lifelong learners, to work with each other and to reflect on their learning.nThrough responding to and composing texts from Kindergarten to Year 10, students learn about the power, value and art of the English language for communication, knowledge and enjoyment. They engage with and explore texts that include widely acknowledged quality literature of past and contemporary societies and engage with the literature and literary heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. By composing and responding with imagination, feeling, logic and conviction, students develop understanding of themselves and of human experience and culture. They develop clear and precise skills in speaking, listening, reading, writing, viewing and representing, and knowledge and understanding of language forms and features and structures of texts.nThe study of English in this syllabus is founded on the belief that language learning is recursive and develops through ever-widening contexts. Students learn English through explicit teaching of language and through their engagement with a diverse range of purposeful and increasingly demanding language experiences. The English K–10 Syllabus enables teachers to draw on the methods of different theoretical perspectives and models for teaching English to assist their students to achieve the syllabus outcomes at the highest levels. The syllabus is linked to the purpose statement and broad learning outcomes of the K–10 Curriculum Framework.nIn their study of English, students continue to develop their critical and imaginative faculties and broaden their capacity for cultural understanding. They examine the contexts of language usage to understand how meaning is shaped by a variety of social factors. As students’ command of English grows, they are able to question, assess, challenge and reformulate information and use creative and analytical language to identify and clarify issues and solve problems. They become imaginative and confident users of a range of electronic and digital technologies and understand and reflect on the ongoing impact of these technologies on society. These skills and understandings allow them to develop their control of language in ways that will help them in lifelong learning, in their careers and in life.","","","","","",""

Children are connected with and contribute to their world.n3.	Children have a strong sense of wellbeing.n4.	Children are confident and involved learners.n5.	Children are effective communicators.nIn addition, teachers need to acknowledge the learning that children bring to school, and plan appropriate learning experiences that make connections with existing language and literacy development, including language used at home.","Stage 5","By the end of Stage 5 students respond to and compose a comprehensive range of imaginative, factual and critical texts using different modes and technologies. They enjoy, reflect on, critically assess and articulate processes of response and composition. They respond to and compose a wide range of simple and complex texts for pleasure, critical analysis and information-gathering, varying their approach according to a text’s purpose, audience and context. They focus on details of texts to analyse meaning, perspective, cultural assumptions, ideologies and language.nStudents use varying technologies to compose texts. They apply their knowledge of the elements that shape meaning in texts. They use a range of strategies to shape their texts to address purpose and audience in different contexts. They conform to or challenge an audience’s preconceptions and expectations about content and form, and they evaluate the effectiveness of each approach. Students display a developing personal style in their personal, imaginative, critical and analytical compositions. They work through the composing process, including planning, researching, drafting, conferencing, editing and publishing. Students reflect on their composing process and how it has affected the final version of their text.nStudents respond to texts from different cultures that offer a range of perspectives. In considering possible meanings, they develop sustained interpretations supported by evidence and think creatively beyond the text. They infer and interpret, and investigate the similarities and differences between and among texts. Through close and wide engagement with texts students extend their imaginations and engage with images of their real and imagined worlds. They respond imaginatively and critically to verbal and visual imagery and iconography, considering how these and other features reflect the cultural context of the text. By critically evaluating texts, students identify strengths and weaknesses and are able to articulate coherent responses. From their responses to individual texts they generalise about views of the world and strategies that are used to communicate and sustain such views.nStudents reflect on their own and others’ learning, assessing learning strategies and purposes to adapt their knowledge, understanding and skills to new contexts.","",""
"Organisation of Content","For Kindergarten to Year 10, courses of study and educational programs are based on the outcomes of syllabuses. The content describes in more detail how the outcomes are to be interpreted and used, and the intended learning appropriate for the stage. In considering the intended learning, teachers will make decisions about the sequence, the emphasis to be given to particular areas of content, and any adjustments required based on the needs, interests and abilities of their students.nThe knowledge, understanding and skills described in the outcomes and content provide a sound basis for students to successfully move to the next stage of learning.","Content and the use of terminology","","Responding and composing","In the English K–10 Syllabus, the study of English is an active pursuit where students use language to learn about language. The key processes of responding to and composing texts are central to students using language purposefully and meaningfully and engaging with a wide range of texts.n‘Responding’ is the activity that occurs as students read, listen to or view texts. It encompasses the personal and intellectual connection a student makes with texts. It also recognises that students and the texts to which they respond reflect social contexts. Responding typically involves:nshaping and arranging textual elements to explore and express ideas, emotions and valuesnidentifying, comprehending, selecting, articulating, imagining, critically analysing and evaluating.nIn this syllabus, ‘composing’ is the activity that occurs as students produce written, spoken or visual texts. Composing typically involves:nshaping, making and arranging textual elements to explore and express ideas, emotions and valuesnprocesses of imagining, drafting, appraising, reflecting and refiningnknowledge, understanding and use of the language forms, features and structures of texts.nAs students undertake the key processes of responding to and composing texts in their study of English, they undertake a number of other integrated and concurrent processes which also highlight the importance of students as active users and learners of language. The processes in this syllabus are intended to emphasise student agency through students developing and applying knowledge and understanding of context and language forms and features, and reflecting on their learning. In addition to the key processes of responding and composing, these processes include:nengaging personally with textsndeveloping and applying contextual knowledgenunderstanding and applying knowledge of language forms and features.nThe key processes also help to organise and emphasise content in this syllabus within and across stages of learning.","Use of terminology","The generic terms ‘composer’ and ‘compose’ can be used in preference to ‘author’ and ‘create’ as used in the Australian Curriculum. The use of the terms ‘composer’ and ‘compose’ does not preclude use of specific nomenclature such as ‘poet’, ‘writer’, ‘novelist’ or ‘playwright’ by teachers and students where appropriate."

This includes the study of texts which are widely regarded as quality literature, providing students with the opportunity for aesthetic experience and to develop an appreciation of the artistic expression found in texts.nIn the primary years of schooling, the study of text types, as part of a broader study of texts, is intended to facilitate student literacy skills and help to establish knowledge about the purpose and audience, structures and language features of a broader range of texts. In the categorisation of texts into ‘text types’, it is important to note that any such classification is to some extent arbitrary and that there is always likely to be overlap between ways of grouping and defining texts.nWhile delivering courses that reflect the outcomes and content, the following text requirements should be addressed.nStudents in K–6 must read, listen to and view a variety of texts that are appropriate to their needs, interests and abilities. These texts become increasingly sophisticated as students move from Kindergarten to Year 6.nIn each Year students must study examples of:nspoken textsnprint textsnvisual textsnmedia, multimedia and digital texts.nAcross a stage of learning, the selection of texts must give students experience of:ntexts which are widely regarded as quality literaturena widely defined Australian literature, including texts that give insights into Aboriginal experiences in Australiana wide range of literary texts from other countries and times, including poetry, drama scripts, prose fiction and picture booksntexts written about intercultural experiencesntexts that provide insights about the peoples and cultures of Asianeveryday and community textsna wide range of factual texts that present information, issues and ideasntexts that include aspects of environmental and social sustainabilitynan appropriate range of digital texts, including film, media and multimedia.nIn selecting specific texts for study in English, teachers should consider the needs, interests and abilities of their students and the ethos of the school and its local community.nNote: students with disability may not be able to use all or some of the language modes.

Literacy knowledge and skills provide students with the foundations for current and future learning and for participation in the workplace and wider society. The knowledge and skills also provide opportunities for personal enrichment through social interaction, further education, training and skilled employment and a range of cultural pursuits, including engagement with literature and the arts. Literacy knowledge and skills also enable students to better understand and negotiate the world in which they live and to contribute to a democratic society through becoming ethical and informed citizens.nBeing ‘literate’ is more than the acquisition of technical skills: it includes the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create and communicate purposefully using written, visual and digital forms of expression and communication for a number of purposes in different contexts. The English learning area has a particular role in developing literacy because of its inherent focus on language and meaning. However, all curriculum areas have a responsibility for the general literacy requirements of students as they construct meaning for themselves and others.nThe established functions of speaking and listening, reading and writing, and viewing and representing remain central to being literate together with literacy demands related to a range of visual and multimodal texts, as well as those that have evolved from the growth of digital technologies. Students today need the knowledge and skills required for judicious use of these technologies and to question, challenge and evaluate the role of these technologies and the wider implications of their use for contemporary society."
