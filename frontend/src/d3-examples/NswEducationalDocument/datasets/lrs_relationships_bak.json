This can be used as a standalone activity targeting specific vocabulary skills or as part of series of lessons designed to build comprehension skills. Teachers can adapt the activity to suit their current unit of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within this task based on the focus vocabulary selected by the teacher. Teachers can also use this learning sequence as a model for developing their own lesson sequence based on other quality texts. ",

These activities can be easily used and adapted across KLAs.<br/>The activities in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills in the structure of texts and the textual features of a variety of text types. Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas.",

They might be in the sentences or paragraphs surrounding an unfamiliar word. Typical context clues may be: a definition or restatement of the word, an example of the word, a synonym for the word, a contrasting word, a cause and effect relationship, information about the topic and subject of the text, or the grammatical function of the word as it is used in the text.<br/>This resource might be used when students have explored literal comprehension and are interpreting more complex texts that include abstract ideas and vocabulary. Alternatively, this resource can be used as a standalone activity targeting specific skills. Teachers can adapt the activity to suit their current unit of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within this task based on the focus vocabulary selected by the teacher.<br/>Teachers can also use this learning sequence as a model for developing their own lesson sequence based on other quality texts.

This resource can also be used to enhance collaboration in the classroom.<br/>Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas.",

  "Description" : "This guide has a list of the 44 phonemes in Standard Australian English and videos showing how to pronounce each phoneme.<br/>Phonemic awareness is one of the five subskills of phonological awareness. Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts.<br/>Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Phonemic awareness is a basic phonological awareness skill and is important as a foundation and precursor skill for learning to decode and encode written words.<br/>It Is necessary to grasp the alphabetic code that underlies the system of written language. That is letters (graphemes) on the page are a code for phonemes in spoken words. Blending phonemes together smoothly to say words supports decoding and fluency in word learning and recognition.<br/>Proficiency in oral blending and segmenting before introducing the layer of phonics lessens the cognitive load making it easier to blend and segment with letters.",

This PowerPoint is part of a package of complementary resources, that also includes printable decodable texts and student independent practice sheets. These power point lessons could be used with a whole class or small groups when explicitly introducing the phonemes /l/ as in lip and the graphemes that can be used to represent these sounds. It can also be used when learning that another way to represent the /s/ phoneme is with an SS, as in the word hiss. It also focuses on showing how to blend the letter/sounds to make and read words.<br/>These PowerPoint lessons are fully editable, allowing teachers to adapt lessons and activities based on student need.",

There are individual assessments that assess either grammar, punctuation or spelling, as well as assessments that assess a combination of these language features. The short assessments are mapped to NSW syllabus outcomes for Stage 4 and Literacy Learning Progression indicators. Teachers can group together or modify these short assessments to suit the learning needs of their students. They are easy to administer and available as Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, and PDF. When students have completed the assessments, teachers can download a class overview in the form of an excel spreadsheet detailing their student responses.<br/>When using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms, the student receives immediate feedback on their answers. Teachers can use this information to inform planning and programming.<br/>This resource can be used for both formative and summative assessment.<br/>The short assessments are grouped by stage with links to K-10 English syllabus outcomes clearly identified. Each assessment question is also linked to a specific learning progression indicator, to assist teachers in selecting the most appropriate assessments and questions to use with students.",

  "Description" : "An explanation of rhyming, onset and rime awareness, a sequence of learning to develop the skill and ideas for classroom activities.<br/>Rhyming, onset and rime awareness is one of the five subskills of phonological awareness. Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts.<br/>Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Rhyming and onset & rime awareness is an early phonological awareness skill used as a scaffold for learning phonemic awareness skills. Having this awareness supports refining the skill of tuning into the sound structure within a spoken word.<br/>Using onset and rime as the units of sound builds on prior learning and further develops the skill of blending and segmenting needed for phonemic awareness.<br/>The resource includes details of how to increase or decrease the complexity of the activity ranging in stages from recognition through to production of rhymes.",

  "Description" : "Rolling two dice is a task that supports additive thinking.<br/>This activity is for students to develop flexible strategies with numbers up to 20. Students need efficient counting practices in number sense and place value to support additive thinking. Knowing and describing teen numbers as 1 ten and some more (QuN8.3) can be observed through this task. Students need a understanding of place value to be able to count, decompose, rename and exchange numbers in multiple ways.<br/>Teachers can use this to target their teaching for students who need to develop their perceptual skills.

  "Description" : "An explanation of word awareness, a sequence of learning to develop the skill and ideas for classroom activities. Word awareness is one of the five subskills of phonological awareness.<br/>Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts. Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Word awareness is an early phonological awareness skill. It is the first step in tuning into the sound structure of spoken language. Word awareness assists in making the connection between the spoken and written word. Using words as the unit of sound supports learning the skill of segmenting.<br/>The resource includes details of how to increase or decrease the complexity of the activity by using more or less complex words and increased sentence length.

The questions relate to a stimulus text covering reading comprehension, reading processes and vocabulary. The assessments are mapped to NSW syllabus outcomes from Stage 4 to Stage 5 and Literacy Learning Progression indicators. They are also mapped to relevant teaching strategies and links to these are provided. Teachers can group together or modify these short assessments to suit the learning needs of their students. They are easy to administer and available as Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, and PDF. When students have completed the assessments, teachers can download a class overview in the form of an excel spreadsheet detailing their student responses. When using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms, the student receives immediate feedback on their answers. Teachers can use this information to inform planning and programming.<br/>This resource can be used for both formative and summative assessment.<br/>The short assessments are grouped by stage with links to K-10 English syllabus outcomes clearly identified. Each assessment question is also linked to a specific learning progression indicator, to assist teachers in selecting the most appropriate assessments and questions to use with students.",

Teachers might use these activities when students have already explored descriptive language and structural features of texts and are now exploring figurative and playful language choices.<br/>Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas.",

A link to a video of an example lesson is included.<br/>Phonemic awareness is one of the five subskills of phonological awareness. Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts.<br/>Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>Phonemic awareness is a basic phonological awareness skill and is important as a foundation and precursor skill for learning to decode and encode written words. It Is necessary to grasp the alphabetic code that underlies the system of written language. That is letters (graphemes) on the page are a code for phonemes in spoken words. Blending phonemes together smoothly to say words supports decoding and fluency in word learning and recognition.<br/>Proficiency in oral blending and segmenting before introducing the layer of phonics lessens the cognitive load making it easier to blend and segment with letters.<br/>The resource includes details of how to scaffold the activity with supporting materials to meet specific learning needs.",

  "Description" : "This resource explains context clues and has an example think aloud that models how to use context clues to infer the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary.<br/>Think alouds are an opportunity for students to 'eavesdrop' on the thinking and cognitive processing of the teacher. They are an important part of explicit teaching and can be used to ensure that students understand how skilled readers use a range of metacognitive strategies to comprehend and interact with texts.<br/>This resource is an example of a think aloud using a text from the Eat for health website as part of a Stage 3 PDHPE focus on healthy eating habits. Think alouds can be used at all stages of explicit teaching. It is important that teachers use think alouds during modelled instruction and shared practice as this will provide students with an opportunity to see and hear the cognitive processing a skilled reader uses when comprehending texts. Once students are confident with the process of a think aloud and the focus skill of the learning sequence, think alouds can also be adapted for use in guided and collaborative practice. This will provide the opportunity for students to verbalise their thinking and receive feedback from their peers. Think alouds can be adapted and used with students across all grades and in all subject areas. ",

This resource will enable students to build their decoding, phonics, spelling and vocabulary skills. When students add or rearrange letters to make a new word, they must examine the phoneme/grapheme relationships with automaticity and pace. By doing so, students learn to decode and spell accurately. By adding meaning, in the form of a definition, students can extend their understanding of words and concepts.",

Syllable awareness is one of the five subskills of phonological awareness.<br/>Phonological awareness is a critical skill for all students' literacy development and a predictor of later reading and spelling success. Phonological awareness refers to oral language and is the understanding of the different ways that language can be broken down into smaller parts. Phonological awareness consists of five subskills beginning with word awareness, syllable awareness, onset/rime awareness, moving to the more complex subskills of basic and advanced phonemic awareness.<br/>The skills of segmenting and blending are easier to learn using syllables, a larger unit of sound. Developing fluency and automaticity using syllables makes the process easier when students are ready to blend and segment using phonemes, the smallest unit of sound. Students must have an understanding, of what a 'word' is, before beginning instruction in syllable awareness.<br/>The resource includes details of how to increase or decrease the complexity of the activity by using more or less complex words.

  "Description" : "A selection of 28 short assessments that can be used by Years 3-6 teachers to assess student understanding of language conventions including grammar, punctuation and spelling, and provide feedback to students about their learning.<br/>These short assessments can be used to provide teachers with feedback about student understanding of the language conventions needed for student reading progress. There are individual assessments that assess either grammar, punctuation or spelling, as well as assessments that assess a combination of these language features. The short assessments are mapped to NSW syllabus outcomes from Stage 2 to Stage 3 and Literacy Learning Progression indicators. Teachers can group together or modify these short assessments to suit the learning needs of their students. They are easy to administer and available as Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, and PDF. When students have completed the assessments, teachers can download a class overview in the form of an excel spreadsheet detailing their student responses. When using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms, the student receives immediate feedback on their answers. Teachers can use this information to inform planning and programming.<br/>This resource can be used for both formative and summative assessment.<br/>The short assessments are grouped by stage with links to K-10 English syllabus outcomes clearly identified. Each quiz question is also linked to a specific learning progression indicator, to assist teachers in selecting the most appropriate assessments and questions to use with students.",

This resource might be used when students are learning about the structural and text features of imaginative, persuasive and informative types of text, and are learning about why and how texts are constructed.<br/>The activities in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills in identifying audience and purpose and how these are established. Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning. There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas.",

This understanding will support teachers to choose the best words for focused instruction.<br/>The three-tiered model of vocabulary development, described by Beck, McKeown, and Kucan (2013) is a framework to classify words.<br/>This guide explains the three tiers and provides questions to support teachers as they select Tier 2 words for explicit instruction and assessment. The guide also includes an example list of Tier 2 and 3 words for a science unit of study (insert link https://education.nsw.gov.au/content/dam/main-education/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/key-learning-areas/science/media/documents/science-and-technology-s3-earth-and-space-learning-sequence.docx).<br/>Teachers can use the guide when planning units of learning in all subject areas.

There are opportunities for variations to learning and differentiation within most tasks. This includes the use of pair and small group structures, offering opportunities for peer support as well as oral practice and experimentation with target language and ideas.",

  "Description" : "Numberless graphs are a teaching technique where information in a graph is slowly revealed to students. As they work through a number of noticing and wondering discussions, adjusting their thinking with each new piece of information, they develop a better understanding of the data story in both its whole and its parts. Numberless graphs build on the work of Brian Bushart and 'numberless word problems'. In his blog Teaching to the beat of a different drummer, Brian Bushart states, 'numberless word problems are designed to provide scaffolding that allows students the opportunity to develop a better understanding of the underlying structure of word problems.' He later applied this idea to numberless graphs.",

They are also mapped to relevant teaching strategies and links to these are provided. Teachers can group together or modify these short assessments to suit the learning needs of their students. They are easy to administer and available as Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, and PDF. When students have completed the assessments, teachers can download a class overview in the form of an excel spreadsheet detailing their student responses. When using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms, the student receives immediate feedback on their answers. Teachers can use this information to inform planning and programming.<br/>This resource can be used for both formative and summative assessment. The short assessments are grouped by stage with links to K-10 English syllabus outcomes clearly identified. Each assessment question is also linked to a specific learning progression indicator, to assist teachers in selecting the most appropriate assessment and questions to use with students.",

Students use the scale to demonstrate the breadth (number of words) and depth (level of knowing) of their vocabulary knowledge.<br/>The scale supports students to:<br/>- demonstrate word consciousness by recognising if a word is familiar or unfamiliar,<br/>- identify the connections focus words have to other words (synonyms, antonyms and translations),<br/>- define or explain the meaning/s of focus vocabulary,<br/>- use focus words appropriately by writing sentence/s (writing multiple sentences provides an opportunity for students to show how words can sometimes have multiple meanings or that they can be used in different contexts).<br/>This resource can be used to assess student vocabulary knowledge both pre and post explicit vocabulary instruction. Teachers can cater for the learning needs of individual students by selecting what vocabulary will be the focus of explicit instruction and targeted assessment.",

It can be used by teachers to support explicit teaching of focus vocabulary as well as to develop effective routines for exploring vocabulary. The Word mat vocabulary routine provides an opportunity for students to develop a deep understandings of words, by supporting the explicit teaching of the meanings of introduced vocabulary, the relationships and connections between words, as well as opportunities to practice using new vocabulary through listening, speaking, reading and writing activities.<br/>This resource can be used to support explicit vocabulary instruction and student exploration of tier 2 words. Once completed, the graphic organiser can be displayed in the classroom for further reference by students. Teachers select vocabulary that will be the focus of explicit instruction based on individual student learning needs. ",

Students explore how words convey different 'shades of meaning' by sequencing words along a word cline.<br/>The Word cline vocabulary routine provides an opportunity for students to develop a deep understandings of words, by supporting the explicit teaching of the meanings of introduced vocabulary, the relationships and connections between words, as well as opportunities to practice using new vocabulary through listening, speaking, reading and writing activities. Once completed, the graphic organiser can be displayed in the classroom for further reference by students.<br/>This resource can be used to support explicit vocabulary instruction and student exploration of tier 2 words. Once completed, the graphic organiser can be displayed in the classroom for further reference by students.

The titles in each of the boxes on the Frayer model can be adapted according to need and teaching focus. ",

Teachers might use these activities when considering the structural and language features of texts and in the study of current or controversial issues.<br/>The activities in this resource can be used as a learning sequence or as standalone activities targeting specific skills in critically analysing author perspective and bias and how these are established.<br/>Teachers can adapt the activities to current units of learning.

  "Description" : "The Morphemic word chain vocabulary routine is a visual graphic organiser that can support students in defining and deepening their understanding of unfamiliar vocabulary by looking at words through a morphological lens.<br/>The completed graphic organiser can then be used as a visual reference and resource for students.  The Morphemic word chain vocabulary routine can be used by teachers to explicitly teach morphemes to support student vocabulary development. Morphemes are the smallest meaning parts found in words and include prefixes, suffixes and word roots.<br/>The Morphemic word chain supports student reflection, analysis and manipulation of these different meaning-based elements in words to read, comprehend and spell more words, building the breadth and depth of their vocabulary knowledge.<br/>Once completed, the graphic organiser can be displayed in the classroom for further reference by students during reading and writing activities.<br/>This resource can be used to support explicit vocabulary instruction as well as the explicit teaching of spelling. Teachers select vocabulary that will be the focus of explicit instruction based on individual student learning needs. ",

The intent is for students to read fluently with correct phrasing, intonation, pausing and reading rate. This resource can be used to explicitly develop student's word recognition automaticity and decoding skills when reading printed lyrics to develop student's prosody. Furthermore it develops understanding of the role intonation, pausing and pace has in fluent reading.<br/>This resource can be tailored by selecting poems and rhymes aligned to a particular topic, theme or poet. Students could prepare a poem or rhyme to share with a partner or the class. A poem or rhyme could be prepared as a class assembly item.",
