An implementation of Danny Holten's hierarchical edge bundling algorithm in D3.js, showing dependencies between classes in a software class hierarchy. Dependencies are bundled according to the parent packages. This example uses two layouts: a radial d3.layout.cluster to position the tree nodes, and d3.layout.bundle to group the dependencies into spline bundles. Thanks to Jason Davies for contributing the layout implementation!
